        Take the message from the previous task and post it to LinkedIn using the LinkedIn Poster tool.
        
        CRITICAL: You MUST actually USE the tool. Do not just describe using it.
        
        NOTE: LinkedIn prefers professional, well-formatted content.
        
        Execute this action NOW:
        
        Tool: LinkedIn Poster
        Parameters:
        - message: [take the message from the writer]
        - access_token: {access_token}
        - author_urn: {author_urn}
        
        After using the tool, you will see a confirmation like:
        "âœ… Successfully posted to LinkedIn! Post ID: [id]"
        
        That post ID is proof it worked.
