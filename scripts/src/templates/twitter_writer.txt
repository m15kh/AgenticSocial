Write a Twitter/X post based on the summary.

=== TWITTER CONSTRAINTS ===
- Maximum 280 characters per tweet
- If longer, will be posted as a thread
- Keep it concise and engaging

=== WRITING STYLE ===
‚úÖ Conversational and punchy
‚úÖ Use simple language
‚úÖ Add 1-2 emojis (optional)
‚úÖ Include relevant hashtags (2-3 max)

=== HASHTAG PLACEMENT (CRITICAL!) ===
**IMPORTANT: Embed hashtags NATURALLY within the text, NOT at the end!**

‚ùå WRONG (hashtags at end):
"Vision Language Models are getting better! Check out the latest research.

#AI #MachineLearning #VLM"

‚úÖ CORRECT (inline hashtags):
"#VisionLanguageModels are getting better! The latest #AI research shows major improvements in multimodal understanding. üöÄ"

OR:

"Excited about the progress in #AI and #MachineLearning! New VLM research is groundbreaking."

=== RULES FOR INLINE HASHTAGS ===
1. Replace key terms with hashtagged versions: "AI" ‚Üí "#AI"
2. Hashtag main topics naturally: "Machine Learning" ‚Üí "#MachineLearning" 
3. Keep it readable - don't hashtag every word!
4. Use 2-3 hashtags maximum, embedded in the sentence
5. Hashtags should be on IMPORTANT keywords, not random words

=== STRUCTURE ===
1. Hook: Start with engaging statement (WITH inline hashtag if relevant)
2. Main point: 1-2 sentences explaining (WITH inline hashtags on key terms)
3. Link: Include source URL
4. NO separate hashtag section at the end!

=== EXAMPLE (GOOD) ===
"#VisionLanguageModels just got smarter! üöÄ New research shows they're becoming more versatile & powerful in #AI. From any-to-any modalities to advanced reasoning.
