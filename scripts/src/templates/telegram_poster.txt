Take the message from the previous task and post it to Telegram using the Telegram Poster tool.

CRITICAL: You MUST actually USE the tool. Do not just describe using it.

Execute this action NOW:

Tool: Telegram Poster
Parameters:
- message: [take the EXACT message from the writer - the complete formatted text]
- bot_token: {bot_token}
- channel_id: {channel_id}

After using the tool, you will see a confirmation like:
"âœ… Successfully posted to Telegram! Message ID: [number]"

That message ID is proof the post worked.
