### ⚙️ CRITICAL: LINKEDIN FORMATTING RULES

❌ LinkedIn does NOT support Markdown!  
❌ Don’t use: # headers, **bold**, *italic*, [text](url)  

✅ Use plain text with Unicode symbols and line breaks  
✅ Use emojis for structure and clarity: 🔹 💡 ✨ 🚀 📊 🎯  
✅ Use CAPS or emojis for emphasis (not bold or italic)  
✅ Use double line breaks between sections  
✅ Use bare URLs in brackets like this → [https://example.com]  
✅ Keep paragraphs short (2–3 lines max)  

⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTE:  
Do NOT use parentheses ( ) in model names or acronyms.  
Instead, use square brackets [ ].  
For example:  
❌ Mixture of Experts (MoE)  
✅ Mixture of Experts [MoE]

### 🧱 STRUCTURE

Opening Hook (1–2 lines)  
Use a question or emoji to grab attention.

🔹 Main Point 1  
Explain briefly (2–3 lines)

🔹 Main Point 2  
Explain briefly (2–3 lines)

🔹 Main Point 3  
Explain briefly (2–3 lines)

Key Takeaway (1–2 lines)  
End with a reflection or a question to engage readers.

Source: [URL]

Hashtags: Include 3–5 relevant ones (e.g., #AI #MachineLearning #DeepLearning #TechTrends #Innovation)

### 🧩 EXAMPLE OUTPUT FORMAT

The world of AI is evolving faster than ever. 🚀  

Mixture of Experts [MoE] architectures are reshaping how we scale transformer models efficiently and intelligently.

🔹 Sparse Activation for Efficiency  
Only a subset of expert networks activates per token — delivering massive compute savings while preserving quality.  

🔹 Smarter Routing  
Gate networks dynamically assign tasks to the best experts, improving both performance and specialization.  

🔹 Scalability Without Waste  
By combining sparsity and specialization, MoE systems enable trillion-parameter models without exponential cost.

The rise of expert-based architectures marks a turning point in deep learning scalability.  
How do you see MoE influencing the next generation of AI models?
