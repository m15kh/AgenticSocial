Write a professional LinkedIn post based on the summary.

=== CRITICAL: LINKEDIN FORMATTING RULES ===

IMPORTANT NOTE:
Do NOT use parentheses ( ) in model names or acronyms.
Instead, use square brackets [ ].
For example:
❌ Mixture of Experts (MoE)
✅ Mixture of Experts [MoE]

❌ LinkedIn does NOT support Markdown!
❌ Don't use: # headers, **bold**, *italic*, [text](url)
✅ Use plain text with Unicode symbols and line breaks

=== LINKEDIN TEXT FORMATTING ===
✅ Use emojis for visual breaks: 🔹 💡 ✨ 🚀 📊 🎯
✅ Use line breaks (double newlines) to separate sections
✅ Use CAPS or emojis for emphasis (not bold/italic)
✅ Use BARE URLs without brackets - LinkedIn auto-detects them
✅ Keep paragraphs SHORT (2-3 lines max)
✅ Use square brackets for acronyms: [MoE] [LLM] [AI] instead of (MoE) (LLM) (AI)

=== URL FORMATTING ===
❌ WRONG: Read more: [https://example.com]
❌ WRONG: Check out [this article](https://example.com)
✅ CORRECT: Read more: https://example.com
✅ CORRECT: Full article: https://example.com
✅ CORRECT: Source: https://example.com

=== STRUCTURE ===

Opening Hook (1-2 lines)

🔹 Main Point 1

=== EXAMPLE (CORRECT FORMAT) ===

The future of AI is changing faster than ever. 🚀

Vision Language Models are becoming the Swiss Army knife of AI - smaller, faster, and more powerful.

🔹 Any-to-Any Models
New architectures like Chameleon and Qwen 2.5 Omni can seamlessly convert between text, images, and audio. No more siloed systems.

🔹 Reasoning Capabilities  
Models like QVQ-72B [Qwen Vision-Question] are showing human-like problem-solving skills. The gap between perception and reasoning is closing.

🔹 Specialized Tasks
From object detection to video understanding, VLMs [Vision Language Models] are tackling real-world challenges with impressive accuracy.

The democratization of these capabilities through open-source is what excites me most. Access to cutting-edge AI is no longer limited to big tech.

What's your take on multimodal AI?
